# StatTOPSIS

StatTOPSIS integrates the traditional Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with statistical methods to enhance decision-making robustness. The approach combines multi-criteria decision analysis with sensitivity analysis, bootstrapping, and non-parametric statistical tests to ensure comprehensive evaluation and reliable rankings of alternatives.
